# TrainerAI

TrainerAI is a machine learning–based system designed to assist in generating personalized training and fitness plans using AI. This repository hosts the core model training logic and supporting code for project development and deployment.

---

## Features

- Model training pipeline using TensorFlow (or your chosen framework)  
- Data preprocessing and augmentation modules  
- Ability to input client data (e.g. anthropometrics, goals, history) and generate tailored training suggestions  
- Scripts for evaluation and metrics  
- Modular design to experiment with different architectures, loss functions, and hyperparameters

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frsant/TrainerAI.git
   cd TrainerAI


2. (Optional, recommended) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) If using GPU acceleration, make sure to install compatible versions of TensorFlow, CUDA, etc.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training

The main training pipeline can be run from `ModelTrainerTFG/train.py`:

```bash
python ModelTrainerTFG/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

Typical options include:

* Path to input data file
* Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
* Checkpoint saving options

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python ModelTrainerTFG/evaluate.py --model_path path/to/checkpoint --test_data path/to/test_dataset
```

The script will generate metrics, plots, and/or output files for analysis.

## Project Expansion Ideas

This project is designed to be modular and extensible. Possible enhancements include:

* Integration with a frontend or REST API so clients can submit data and receive plans automatically
* Additional metrics (strength, mobility, progress tracking)
* Continuous retraining or feedback-based learning
* Experimenting with different neural network architectures (LSTM, Transformers, residual networks)
* Exporting optimized models for production (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, etc.)

---

## Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.8
* Packages listed in `requirements.txt` (TensorFlow / PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
* (Optional) GPU access for faster training
* Sufficient disk space for datasets, checkpoints, and logs
